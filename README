 1) If the pdb has H's, then just run

  pdb_to_PAS_pdb.pl

 2) If the pdb does not have H's, then run 

 a) ./reduce -build A_noH.pdb > A.pdb
 b) ./PAS_pdb_format.pl A.pdb > A_final.pdb

 This b) will run pdb_to_PAS_pdb.pl along with a script I 
wrote that protnates the CYS residues, because reduce does
not protonate CYS....

 3) If 1) 2) Fails than 

    a) remove_H.pl A.pdb > A_noH.pdb
    b) Proceed with 2)
